## Description

The Programming Langauge Suggestor is an application quiz for those who are interested in switching careers or learning the basics about programming and are having a hard time deciding which language they want to start with. The quiz asks five questions that focuses on what people want from their work, and what type of work sounds best for them. While the quiz does provide accurate feedback it also links to other languages that couldn't be an answer in the quiz. Possible answers in the quiz are:
* Ruby
* C#
* Python

The secondary webpages listed information about the languages listed above and these four languages:
* JavaSCript
* Go
* Swift
* Rust

While these aren't all the languages that you couuld learn, it's a great baseline when just starting to learn how to code.

To access the code in a text editor:

* Open your terminal or your gitBash
* Choose where you would like the code, and enter the directory/ folder with the cd function.
* (Optional) if you aren't sure where to put it you can make a directory to put it in temporarily by typing in mkdir putting a space, and then putting what you wish to call it. EXM:"mkdir clone" then hit enter to create the directory. Once the directory is made, use the command "cd clone" and press enter.
* Once you are in the directory/ folder you wish to clone the webpage too, type on a new line. "git clone https://github.com/AlesandriaWild/LanguageSuggestorQuiz.git" and hit enter.
* Now type in "code ." and press enter again.
* Your text editior should now open so you can access the code.

## Known Bugs

* For some reason when changing the answer on the fourth question "What project sizes would you like to take on?" if you click "Making medium projectsm with limited maintianace needed" then click on another radio buble, it stays clicked. It won't take it as an answer, however you can't get the bubble to be "unclicked" without refreshing the results.
